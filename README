Twiggy is a cool Mobile Web Widget app!

You can run Twiggy in Opera, or on any mobile phone that uses the Mobile Web Widget runtime.

If you're using a phone, just download the twiggy.wgt file and open it. Otherwise, open the config.xml file with Opera to see a copy of Twiggy on your desktop!

If you have any questions, send them to me at @elliottkember on Twitter.

// Remember, I built this in about two days - so it's a bit messy!

It's not as messy any more. I cleaned it up a bit!

It now works on iPhones and normal browsers too!
